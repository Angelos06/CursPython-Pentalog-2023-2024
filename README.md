This respiratory contains the final assignment given to the participants of the Python Course taught at Pentalog
Our final task was to write a script that takes a URL from the keyboard or from the file "config.ini" and the to print the title and the meta description of the website.
After that, the script will access "config.ini" again to search on "https://www.olx.ro" for the keywords specified in the file,
which is followed by printing the results in ascending order by price.
